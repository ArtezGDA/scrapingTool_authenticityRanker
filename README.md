This tool shows the meta-data of an image, and this meta-data is categorised in a star-ranking system.  Meta-data provides information about other data, in this case about the .JPG.

## Background Information
The starting point of our interest in the meta-data of images was because of the documentary by John Berger, “Ways of Seeing” (episode 2, 1972). In this documentary he discusses and questions the realness of images after it has been reproduced, how art is altered by its reproduction. We ourselves questions this with the modern – internet – era in which we live now. How does an digital image have authenticity? The World Wide Web gives us the opportunity to download, screenshot and copy all the images avaliable. We tried to find a solution for this, in our opion, problem. We used the Meta-Data, the information of the image, to pinpoint the research to the originality of an image.

‘THE UNIQUENESS OF THE ORIGINAL NOW LIES IN IT BEING THE ORIGINAL OF A REPRODUCTION’ (WAYS OF SEEING, P.21) – John Berger

## Ranking-System
The ranking-system is based on meta-data. The meta-data of an image differs in value and we researched the most valuable meta-data, if the meta-data says something about the image specifically. The more specific, like the location or the author of the made image, the more 'stars' that image gets. The more stars, the more authentic the image, the closer to the original image.

## Research Method
Our research method is based on a sample study. In order to determin our ranking/star-system, we first researched Google Image Search itself. We used Google Trends and used the most searched-terms on Google Image within our sample. The ranking of the trend is based on 21st of March:

1.	Hot
2.	Wallpaper
3.	Girl
4.	Sexy
5.	Love
6.	Images
7.	Facebook
8.	Baby
9.	Funny
10.	Amor

For every searchterm we analysed once every five images for its shown meta-data. In order to see the meta-data, we used the extension FxIF 0.4.9.1. In the file named “Steekproef_GoogleImageSearch.md you can see the results.
